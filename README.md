## Structure

The project uses Express.js and PostgreSQL.

User and Group info in the database can be found in the project root folder, inside ```data.js```

Backend server (Express.js) can be found in the project root folder, inside ```server.js```

Frontend functionalities can be found in the ```public``` folder.

General utility functionalities are inside the ```utils``` folder.


## Prerequisites

Node, yarn and PostgreSQL are needed to be installed on the local machine. You have to: 
1. create a database called messages
2. create a role in that database called 'me' with password 'password'
3. give it write and read permissions
4. give it sequence rights.

Optionally, you can use below statements to provide necessary database settings, provided you have a database cluster, and can enter to it 
using psql command line tool.

```
CREATE DATABASE messages;
\c messages;
CREATE TABLE messages ( ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, group_name VARCHAR(30), channel VARCHAR(30), username VARCHAR(30), time VARCHAR(8), text VARCHAR(250) );
CREATE USER me WITH PASSWORD 'password';
GRANT ALL ON messages TO me;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON messages_id_seq TO me;
```

## Running Instructions

1. Run ```yarn``` to download necessary libraries
1. Simply run: ``` node server.js ```
2. Go to ```localhost:3000```
3. Insert any of the users' id and password, which can be found in data.js, in the project root folder.
4. To text with another user, open another browser in **incognito mode**, go to ```localhost:3000``` and login with another user from the data.js file.
